# 👋 Hi, I'm @sbibla

🚀 Senior Software Architect @ Accenture | Enterprise Agentic AI & GenAI Solutions Expert  

I design and deliver **enterprise-grade agentic AI systems** that help organizations leverage the power of AI for real-world business outcomes. My focus is on building **production ready solutions, scalable platforms**, and helping clients adoption of AI via building **Agentic reference architectures and moving agentic POC to production**, to ensure clients build and operate **agentic applications** with confidence.

---

## 💡 What I Do
- **Enterprise Agentic AI Architectures** – designing modular, extensible frameworks for building autonomous agents at scale.
- **From Agentic POC to Prodcution Ready** - transforming early-stage agentic prototypes into secure, scalable, and fully operational enterprise solutions, with production-grade architecture, governance, evals, observability, and long-term maintainability built in.
- **Idnetifying Agentic POC** - working with clients to identify solutions where AI will benefit operation, scale, quality, and UX. Building metrics to evaluation success.
- **Generative AI in Production** – shaping RAG-based (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines that deliver reliable, context-aware AI.  
- **LLM Tuning & Optimization** – applying prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and parameter-efficient methods to align models with enterprise needs.
- **AI Evals**, Responsibility, and Scale: implementing enterprise-grade evaluation frameworks, responsible AI practices, and scalable patterns that ensure AI systems are safe, governed, and production ready.
- **Advisory & Strategy** – guiding leadership teams on AI adoption, platform decisions, and long-term GenAI roadmaps.
